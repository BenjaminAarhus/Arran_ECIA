README:
Public GitHub repository for the survey of two sites north and south of Lochranza in Arran.
This Repository contains the data collected during the ecological survey conducted and the code, graphs, figures, maps, and tables, produced as a result, all to Darwin Core Archive standards.
Taxonomic Groups surveyed were birds, bats, terrestrial mammals, terrestrial invertebrates through net sweeping and pitfall traps, moths, aquatic invertebrates, along with plants and a phase 1 habitat survey of the sites.
The surveys were conducted to gather data on biodiversity and abundance to determine which of the site would be most suitable for potential further development for carbon credit production if either, and the research team would give their recommendation based on the finding of the survey.
